# Data-Structures-Algorithms

This is a repository to maintain the codebase used under my Medium Blogs. 

I generally write the solutions in Java language and you can find them under java folder inside each folder. 

I welcome pull requests for the solutions in any other programming language. I really appreciate your contribution that can help beginners to learn the concept in their preferable languages.

## Steps to be followed for a successful submission
- Check the master branch for the updated content and see that no one has made contribution in your preferred language.
- Please follow the same folder structure as I have followed for solutions in Java Language.
- Similar to `java` folder inside every folder, create a folder with your preferred language name. Ex. swift, python, etc.
- Create a pull request to add your work to the `master` branch.
